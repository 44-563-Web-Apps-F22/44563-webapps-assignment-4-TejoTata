    <h6>SCENE:</h6>
      <P>A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall. In the
            distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
            Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage. Under these rocks is a
            cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L. A
            natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage. As the
            curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
            some playing cards. SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
            one group to another, filling the cups from a flask. FREDERIC is
            seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene. RUTH
            kneels at his feet.</P>

      <p>Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
            Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
            And, to make us more than merry
            Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>

      <p> For today our pirate 'prentice
            Rises from indentures freed;
            Strong his arm, and keen his scent is
            He's a pirate now indeed!</p>

      <h6 class="ALL">ALL: </h6>
      <p> Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
            Fred'ric's out of his indentures.</p>
