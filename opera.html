      <h5>PRINCESS IDA</h5>
      <h6>ACT I - Pavilion in King Hildebrand's Palace -</h6>

      <h6>SCENE: Pavilion attached to King Hildebrand's Palace.
            Soldiers and courtiers discovered looking out through
            opera-glasses, telescopes, etc., Florian leading.</h6>
<div class="a">
      <p >
            Chorus: Search throughout the panorama
            For a sign of royal Gama,
            Who to-day should cross the water
            With his fascinating daughter—
            Ida is her name.

            Some misfortune evidently
            Has detained them — consequently
            Search throughout the panorama
            For the daughter of King Gama,
            Prince Hilarion's flame!
            Prince Hilarion's flame!
            

            SOLO - Florian</p>

      <div class="b">      
      <h6>FLO:</h6> Will Prince Hilarion's hopes be sadly blighted?<br>
      </div>

<div class="a">
      <P> Chorus: Who can tell? Who can tell?</P>
</div>

      <h6>FLO:</h6> Will Ida break the vows that she has plighted?<br>
 <div class="a">
      <p>Chorus: Who can tell? Who can tell?<br></p>
</div>
<div class="b">       
     <h6>FLO:</h6> Will she back out, and say she did not mean them?<br>
</div>

      <div class="a">
             <p>Chorus: Who can tell?</p>
            </div>
<div class="b">  
      <h6>FLO:</h6> If so, there'll be the deuce to pay between them!<br>
</div>
      <div class="a">
      <p>Chorus: No, no — we'll not despair, we'll not despair,For Gama would not dare To make a deadly foe
            Of Hildebrand, and so,
            Search through the panorama
            For a sign of royal Gama,
            Who today should cross the water
            With his fascinating daughter—
            Ida, Ida is her name.</p>
            </div>

      <p>(Enter King Hildebrand with Cyril)</p>

 <div class="b">  
       <h6>HIL:</h6> See you no sign of Gama?<br>
 </div>
 <div class="b">  
      <h6>FLO:</h6> None, my liege!<br>
 </div>
<div class="b">  
      <h6>HIL:</h6> See you no sign of Gama?<br>
      It's very odd indeed. If Gama fail
      To put in an appearance at our Court
      Before the sun has set in yonder west,
      And fail to bring the Princess Ida here
      To whom our son Hilarion was betrothed
      At the extremely early age of one,
      There's war between King Gama and ourselves!
      <p>(aside to Cyril)</p>
      Oh, Cyril, how I dread this interview!
      It's twenty years since he and I have met.
      He was a twisted monster — all awry——
      As though Dame Nature, angry with her work,
      Had crumpled it in fitful petulance!<br>

      <h6>CYR:</h6>But, sir, a twisted and ungainly trunk
      Often bears goodly fruit. Perhaps he was
      A kind, well-spoken gentleman?<br>
</div>
<div class="b">  
      <h6>HIL:</h6> See you no sign of Gama?<br>
      Oh, no!
      For, adder-like, his sting lay in his tongue.
</div>
      <p>(His "sting" is present, though his "stung" is past.)</p><br>
 <div class="b">  
      <h6>FLO:</h6>
      <p>(looking through glass)</p>
      But stay, my liege; o'er yonder mountain's brow
      Comes a small body, bearing Gama's arms;
      And now I look more closely at it, sir,
      I see attached to it King Gama's legs;
      From which I gather this corollary
      That that small body must be Gama's own!<br></div>

 <div class="b"> 
      <h6>HIL:</h6>See you no sign of Gama?<br>
      Ha! Is the Princess with him?<br>
      </div>

 <div class="b">  
      <h6>FLO:</h6>Well, my liege,Unless her highness is full six feet high,
      And wears mustachios too — and smokes cigars——
      And rides en cavalier in coat of steel——
      I do not think she is.</p>
