      <h5>THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE</h5>
      <h6 class="ACT">ACT I - A rocky sea-shore on the coast of Cornwall -</h6>

      <h6>SCENE:</h6>
      <P>A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall. In the
            distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
            Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage. Under these rocks is a
            cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L. A
            natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage. As the
            curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
            some playing cards. SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
            one group to another, filling the cups from a flask. FREDERIC is
            seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene. RUTH
            kneels at his feet.</P>

      <p>Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
            Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
            And, to make us more than merry
            Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>

      <h6 class="SAMUEL">SAMUEL:</h6>
      <p> For today our pirate 'prentice
            Rises from indentures freed;
            Strong his arm, and keen his scent is
            He's a pirate now indeed!</p>

      <h6 class="ALL">ALL: </h6>
      <p> Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
            Fred'ric's out of his indentures.</p>


      <h6 class="SAMUEL"> SAMUEL:</h6>
      <p>Two and twenty, now he's rising,
            And alone he's fit to fly,
            Which we're bent on signalizing
            With unusual revelry.</P>

      <h5 class="song">SONG — RUTH</h5>

      <h6>RUTH: </h6>
      <p class="song"> When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and
            daring,
            His father thought he'd 'prentice him to some career
            seafaring.
            I was, alas! his nurs'rymaid, and so it fell to my lot
            To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
            pilot —
            A life not bad for a hardy lad, though surely not a
            high lot,
            Though I'm a nurse, you might do worse than make your
            boy a pilot.
            I was a stupid nurs'rymaid, on breakers always
            steering,
            And I did not catch the word aright, through being hard
            of hearing;
            Mistaking my instructions, which within my brain did
            gyrate,
            I took and bound this promising boy apprentice to a
            pirate.
            A sad mistake it was to make and doom him to a vile
            lot.
            I bound him to a pirate — you! — instead of to a
            pilot.
            I soon found out, beyond all doubt, the scope of this
            disaster,
            But I hadn't the face to return to my place, and break
            it to my master.
            A nurs'rymaid is not afraid of what you people call
            work,
            So I made up my mind to go as a kind of piratical maid-
            of-all-work.
            And that is how you find me now, a member of your shy
            lot,
            Which you wouldn't have found, had he been bound
            apprentice to a pilot.</p>
