    <h5>PRINCESS IDA</h5>
    <h6>ACT I - Pavilion in King Hildebrand's Palace -</h6>
    <h6>SCENE: Pavilion attached to King Hildebrand's Palace.
        Soldiers and courtiers discovered looking out through
        opera-glasses, telescopes, etc., Florian leading.</h6>
        <h6>
            Chorus:      Search throughout the panorama
            For a sign of royal Gama,
                 Who to-day should cross the water
                 With his fascinating daughter—
                       Ida is her name.<br>

            Some misfortune evidently
            Has detained them — consequently
                 Search throughout the panorama
                 For the daughter of King Gama,
                       Prince Hilarion's flame!
                       Prince Hilarion's flame!<br>

                               SOLO - Florian<br>

Florian:     Will Prince Hilarion's hopes be sadly blighted?<br>

Chorus:                             Who can tell?  Who can tell?<br>

Florian:     Will Ida break the vows that she has plighted?<br>

Chorus:                             Who can tell?  Who can tell?<br>

Florian:     Will she back out, and say she did not mean them?<br>

Chorus:                             Who can tell?<br>

Florian:     If so, there'll be the deuce to pay between them!<br>

Chorus:           No, no — we'll not despair, we'll not despair,<br>
                 For Gama would not dare
                 To make a deadly foe
                 Of Hildebrand, and so,
                       Search through the panorama
                       For a sign of royal Gama,
                       Who today should cross the water
                       With his fascinating daughter—
                       Ida, Ida is her name.<br>

                                           (Enter King Hildebrand
with Cyril)<br>

Hildebd:     See you no sign of Gama?<br>

Florian:                            None, my liege!<br>

Hildebd:     It's very odd indeed.  If Gama fail
            To put in an appearance at our Court
            Before the sun has set in yonder west,
            And fail to bring the Princess Ida here
            To whom our son Hilarion was betrothed
            At the extremely early age of one,
            There's war between King Gama and ourselves!
                 (aside to Cyril)
            Oh, Cyril, how I dread this interview!
            It's twenty years since he and I have met.
            He was a twisted monster — all awry——
            As though Dame Nature, angry with her work,
            Had crumpled it in fitful petulance!<br>

Cyril:       But, sir, a twisted and ungainly trunk
            Often bears goodly fruit.  Perhaps he was
            A kind, well-spoken gentleman?<br>

Hildebd:                                        Oh, no!
            For, adder-like, his sting lay in his tongue.
            (His "sting" is present, though his "stung" is past.)<br>

Florian:     (looking through glass)
            But stay, my liege; o'er yonder mountain's brow
            Comes a small body, bearing Gama's arms;
            And now I look more closely at it, sir,
            I see attached to it King Gama's legs;
            From which I gather this corollary
            That that small body must be Gama's own!<br>

Hildebd:     Ha! Is the Princess with him?<br>

Florian:                                  Well, my liege,
                 Unless her highness is full six feet high,
            And wears mustachios too — and smokes cigars——
            And rides en cavalier in coat of steel——
            I do not think she is.</h6>
    <h6>ACT II - Gardens of Castle Adamant</h6>
    <h6> SCENE: Gardens in Castle Adamant.  A river runs across the
        back of the stage, crossed by a rustic bridge.  Castle
        Adamant in the distance.
    </h6>
    <h6>Chorus:           Towards the empyrean heights<br>
        Of ev'ry kind of lore,
  We've taken several easy flights,
        And mean to take some more.
  In trying to achieve success
        No envy racks our heart,
  And all the knowledge we possess,
        We mutually impart.<br>

                SOLO — Melissa<br>

  Pray, what authors should she read
  Who in Classics would succeed?<br>

                SOLO — Psyche

  If you'd climb the Helicon,
  You should read Anacreon,
  Ovid's Metamorphoses,
  Likewise Aristophanes,
  And the works of Juvenal:
  These are worth attention, all;
  But, if you will be advised,
  You will get them Bowdlerized!<br>

Chorus:           Ah! we will get them Bowdlerized!

              SOLO — Sacharissa

  Pray you, tell us, if you can,
  What's the thing that's known as Man?

                SOLO — Psyche

  Man will swear and man will storm—
  Man is not at all good form—
  Is of no kind of use—
  Man's a donkey — Man's a goose—
  Man is coarse and Man is plain—
  Man is more or less insane—
  Man's a ribald — Man's a rake,
  Man is Nature's sole mistake!<br>

Chorus:           We'll a memorandum make—
  Man is Nature's sole mistake!

  And thus to empyrean height
        Of ev'ry kind of lore,
  In search of wisdom's pure delight,
        Ambitiously we soar.
  In trying to achieve success
        No envy racks our heart,
  For all we know and all we guess
        We mutually impart!
  And all the knowledge we possess,
        We mutually impart,
        We mutually impart, impart.

(Enter Lady Blanche.  All stand up demurely)<br>

Blanche:     Attention, ladies, while I read to you<br>
The Princess Ida's list of punishments.
The first is Sacharissa.  She's expelled!<br>

All:         Expelled!<br>

Blan.:                  Expelled, because although she knew<br>
No man of any kind may pass our walls,
She dared to bring a set of chessmen here!<br>

Sach.:       (Crying)  I meant no harm; they're only men of wood!<br>
</h6>
    <h6>ACT III - Courtyard of Castle Adamant</h6>
    <h6>SCENE — Outer Walls and Courtyard of Castle Adamant.  Melissa,
        SachaRissa, and ladies discovered, armed with
        battleaxes.</h6>
    <h6>  Chorus:           Death to the invader!
        Strike a deadly blow,
  As an old Crusader
        Struck his Paynim foe!
              Let our martial thunder
              Fill his soul with wonder,
              Tear his ranks asunder,
                    Lay the tyrant low!
  Death to the invader!
        Strike a deadly blow,
  As an old Crusader
        Struck his Paynim foe!<br>

Melissa:          Thus our courage, all untarnish'd,
        We're instructed to display;
  But to tell the truth unvarnish'd,
        We are more inclined to say,
  "Please you, do not hurt us,"<br>

All:                    "Do not hurt us, if it please you!"<br>

Melissa:          "Please you let us be."<br>

All:                    "Let us be — let us be!"<br>

Melissa:          "Soldiers disconcert us."<br>

All:                    "Disconcert us, if it please you!"<br>

Melissa:          "Frighten'd maids are we!"<br>

  All:                    "Maids are we, maids are we!"<br>

  Melissa:          Please you,<br>

  All:                    Do not hurt us;<br>

  Melissa:          Please you,<br>

  All:                    Let us be.<br>

  Mel & Cho:        Frighten'd maids are we, frighten'd maids are we!</h6>
